x86doc
======

I needed a complete and recent list of all x86 instruction with their signatures and descriptions for a personal project ([AsmDude][1]). Intel's x86 Instruction Set Reference documentation (found [here][2]) has all this information, but it does not provide a method to query the information. The html pages generated by the original code (found [here][3]) could be transformed by a small Java program to extract the information I needed.

The set is also available online at [https://hjlebbink.github.io/x86doc/][4].

Update:
